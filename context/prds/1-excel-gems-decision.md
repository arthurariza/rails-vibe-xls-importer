# Excel Gems Decision PRD

## Problem Statement
The XLS Importer application requires both reading and writing Excel files. Users need to:
- Generate Excel files from application data
- Upload Excel files back to the application for processing
- Ensure header validation and data integrity during import/export

## Options Evaluated

### Option 1: Single Gem Approach
**`spreadsheet` gem:**
- ✅ Can read and write Excel files
- ❌ Limited .xlsx support (modern Excel format)
- ❌ Primarily supports older .xls format
- ❌ Less active maintenance
- ❌ Potential compatibility issues with modern Excel files

### Option 2: Two Gem Approach (SELECTED)
**`roo` + `axlsx` combination:**
- ✅ `roo` is the most mature and reliable Excel reading library
- ✅ Supports all Excel formats (.xls, .xlsx, .csv)
- ✅ `axlsx` produces clean, compatible .xlsx files
- ✅ Both gems are actively maintained
- ✅ Proven track record in production applications
- ❌ Requires two dependencies instead of one

### Option 3: Alternative Single Gems
**`roo` only:** Cannot write Excel files
**`axlsx` only:** Cannot read Excel files

## Decision
**Selected: Two Gem Approach (`roo` + `axlsx`)**

## Rationale
1. **Reliability**: Both gems are battle-tested and actively maintained
2. **Format Support**: Complete coverage of all Excel formats
3. **Compatibility**: Ensures files work across different Excel versions
4. **Community**: Large user base and good documentation
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each gem specializes in one operation (read vs write)

## Technical Requirements
- `roo` gem for reading Excel files during import
- `axlsx` gem for generating Excel files during export
- Support for .xlsx format (modern Excel standard)
- Backward compatibility with .xls format through `roo`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application can generate Excel files with dynamic headers (5 columns)
- [ ] Application can read uploaded Excel files
- [ ] Header validation works correctly
- [ ] Data import/export maintains data integrity
- [ ] Compatible with common Excel clients (Excel, LibreOffice, Google Sheets)

## Implementation Notes
- Add both gems to Gemfile
- Create service classes for Excel operations
- Implement proper error handling for file format issues
- Ensure memory efficiency for large files

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Two dependencies instead of one
- **Mitigation**: Both gems are stable and widely used, minimal maintenance overhead
- **Risk**: Potential version compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Pin gem versions and test thoroughly during updates
