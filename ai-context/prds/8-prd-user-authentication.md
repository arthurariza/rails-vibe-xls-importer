# PRD: User Authentication with Devise

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of user authentication for the XLS Importer prototype application using the Devise gem. The authentication system will secure access to the application and ensure users can only access their own imported XLS files, maintaining data privacy and security in a multi-user environment.

## Goals

1. Implement secure user authentication using the Devise gem
2. Restrict application access to authenticated users only
3. Ensure users can only view and manage their own imported XLS files
4. Provide a complete authentication flow including registration, login, logout, email confirmation, and password reset
5. Integrate authentication seamlessly with the existing XLS import/export functionality

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can access the XLS importer application.

2. **As a registered user**, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my previously imported files.

3. **As a logged-in user**, I want to see only my own imported XLS files so that my data remains private from other users.

4. **As a user who forgot their password**, I want to reset my password via email so that I can regain access to my account.

5. **As a registered user**, I want to confirm my email address during registration so that my account is verified.

6. **As a logged-in user**, I want to log out securely so that others cannot access my data on shared devices.

7. **As a user**, I want the option to stay logged in so that I don't have to re-enter my credentials frequently.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must integrate the Devise gem for authentication functionality.
2. The system must require user authentication before accessing any XLS import/export features.
3. The system must provide user registration with email and password validation.
4. The system must send email confirmation links to new users upon registration.
5. The system must provide secure login functionality with email/password.
6. The system must provide password reset functionality via email.
7. The system must provide "Remember Me" functionality for persistent sessions.
8. The system must provide secure logout functionality.
9. The system must associate imported XLS files with the user who created them.
10. The system must filter displayed import templates and data records to show only those belonging to the current user.
11. The system must customize Devise views to match the existing application design (TailwindCSS styling).
12. The system must redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when accessing protected resources.
13. The system must redirect authenticated users to the main dashboard after successful login.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Role-based access control (admin/user roles)
2. OAuth integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
3. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
4. User profile management beyond basic Devise fields
5. User-to-user sharing of XLS files
6. Complex permission systems
7. API authentication (focus on web interface only)

## Design Considerations

1. **UI Integration**: Customize Devise views to match the existing TailwindCSS design system
2. **Navigation**: Add authentication links (Login/Logout/Sign Up) to the main navigation
3. **Form Styling**: Ensure registration and login forms follow the same styling patterns as XLS import forms
4. **Flash Messages**: Style Devise flash messages to match the existing alert/notice styling
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure authentication forms work well on all device sizes

## Technical Considerations

1. **Database**: Add User model with Devise modules and foreign key relationships to existing models
2. **Migration**: Create migration to add user_id to ImportTemplate and DataRecord models
3. **Controllers**: Update existing controllers to scope queries by current_user
4. **Policies**: Consider adding Pundit policies for authorization if needed in future
5. **Email Configuration**: Configure ActionMailer for sending confirmation and reset emails
6. **Session Management**: Use Rails default session handling with Devise
7. **Security**: Ensure proper CSRF protection and secure password requirements

## Success Metrics

1. Users must authenticate before accessing any XLS functionality
2. Users can only see their own imported files (data isolation verified)
3. Registration, login, logout, password reset, and email confirmation flows work without errors
4. Authentication forms match the existing application design
5. No unauthorized access to other users' data
6. Email delivery for confirmations and password resets functions correctly

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement account deletion functionality?
2. What should be the minimum password requirements?
3. How long should email confirmation links remain valid?
4. Should we implement account lockout after failed login attempts?
5. Do we need to migrate existing data to be owned by a default admin user?
